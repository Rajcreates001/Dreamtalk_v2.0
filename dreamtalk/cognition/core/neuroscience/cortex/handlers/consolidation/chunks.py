"""Shared helper: yield memory chunks for a consolidation stage.

Streams via the store's chunked decay cursor when available (PostgreSQL), so
peak RAM is one chunk. Falls back to a single materialized chunk when the
caller already holds a shared snapshot list (the consolidate handler's issue-13
one-load path) or when the store has no chunked cursor (SQLite / test fakes).
