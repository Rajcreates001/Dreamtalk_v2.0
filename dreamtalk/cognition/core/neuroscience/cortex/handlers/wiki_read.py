"""Handler: wiki_read — fetch the raw markdown of a wiki page.

Phase 3.2 of ADR-2244: when the page at the requested path is a redirect
stub, follow the chain transparently and return the target's content.
The response carries a ``redirect_chain`` array recording the paths
walked, so callers can detect and surface a "this page moved" hint to
their users when the caller cares.

Caller can opt out of redirect-following via ``follow_redirects: false``
to read the stub itself (useful for admin / migration tooling that
needs to inspect or rewrite the stub).
