"""Backpressure pipeline — bounded-queue producer/consumer with constant peak RAM.

Pure orchestration logic — depends only on the StreamSource / BatchSink ports
(DIP); does no I/O itself. The injected sinks perform the writes.

Topology: one producer thread drains a StreamSource into a bounded queue;
``concurrency`` worker threads pull batches and call ``BatchSink.write_batch``.
The bounded queue with blocking ``put`` IS the backpressure mechanism (SEDA,
Welsh et al. 2001): when writers fall behind, the queue fills, the producer
blocks, and the source stops fetching. Peak resident payload is
``(queue_cap + concurrency + 1)`` batches — independent of total row count.

Shutdown: the producer emits exactly one sentinel per worker in a ``finally``
(so it fires on the crash path too); each worker consumes exactly one sentinel
and stops; the caller joins all workers before any pool is closed. There is no
other end-of-stream signal in the codebase, so this protocol is load-bearing.
