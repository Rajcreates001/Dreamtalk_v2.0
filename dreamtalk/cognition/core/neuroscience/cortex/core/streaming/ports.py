"""Streaming pipeline ports — producer/consumer contracts.

Pure business logic — no I/O. Infrastructure implements these protocols
(CursorStreamSource, CopyBatchSink, ExecuteManyBatchSink, StagingResolveSink);
handlers wire them into a BackpressurePipeline.

The contracts encode the invariant that makes peak RAM independent of total
row count:
  - every producer is a generator yielding bounded batches, never a full list;
  - every consumer flushes one batch and releases it, never accumulating
    across batches (no stage-spanning buffer — not even a name->id map).

      - Each yielded list is non-empty and ``len(batch) <= max_batch``.

    Contract:

        durably committed and the underlying connection holds NO open
        transaction (commit state must not leak across the abstraction).
      - The sink MUST NOT retain references to rows after return — one batch
        in, one batch written, one batch's worth of RAM.
      - On failure ``write_batch`` raises; the batch is rolled back atomically
        (all-or-nothing). Under ``autocommit=True`` this requires the adapter
        to wrap the write in an explicit ``with conn.transaction():``.
