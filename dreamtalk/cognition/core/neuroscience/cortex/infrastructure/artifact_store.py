"""Content-addressed filesystem store for full raw tool-output artifacts.

When an auto-captured tool output exceeds GIST_BUDGET, the full raw output is
written here and the memory body keeps only a gist + a pointer to the artifact
path (see core/gist_extraction.py and tasks/bounded-io-phase2-design.md F3).
The artifact is a plain Markdown file loadable by the Read tool — zero new MCP
surface, nothing dropped from the corpus.

Content addressing (sha256 of the content) makes repeated identical outputs
dedup to a single file, and monthly sharding (<yyyy-mm>/) keeps directory
fan-out bounded over time.
