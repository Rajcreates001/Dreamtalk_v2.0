"""StreamSource adapters over the store's proven chunked iterators.

Wraps an existing keyset / named-cursor iterator (``iter_hot_memories_chunked``,
``iter_memories_for_decay``, or any ``(chunk_size) -> Iterator[list]`` factory)
as a ``StreamSource``. These iterators already stream at a measured 74MB peak
RSS / ~49.5k rows/s on a 500k-row corpus — the proven primitive; this adapter
only re-exposes them under the pipeline's port.

Pure infrastructure — no core imports (depends only on the injected factory).
